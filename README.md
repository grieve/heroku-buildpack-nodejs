Heroku Buildpack for Node.js (with auto-indexing Forage on build)
============================

This is a fork of the official [Heroku buildpack](http://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/buildpacks) for Node.js apps.

What does it do?
----------------

This buildpack is designed to index a mongo datasource, via a prescribed mapping, for use with a forage instance. This is probably not a great idea, but suits my needs right now.


Further Information
-------------------

Please see the [original repo](https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs) for information on this buildpack. Any special cases or scenarios not outlined in this README should be covered there.
